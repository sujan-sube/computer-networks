### About this Project

This repository was created for ECE 358 Computer Networks. There are a 2 projects in the folders Project 1 and Projct 2.

#### Project 1:

The objective of this project is to create a network queue simulatior. This will help us study two important performance metrics in networks which are **delay** and **packet loss ratio**.
